As electricity distribution systems supply alternate current (AC) power, a converter is required to provide DC power to the battery. Conductive charging can be AC or DC. In the case of an AC EVSE, the AC power is delivered to the onboard charger of the EV, which converts it to DC. A DC EVSE converts the power externally and supplies DC power directly to the battery, bypassing the onboard charger. AC and DC charging are further classified into four charging modes, with Modes 1-3 pertaining to AC charging and Mode 4 pertaining to DC charging. Modes 1 and 2 are applicable for connecting an EV to a standard socket outlet, utilizing a cable and plug. Mode 1, also known as dumb charging, permits no communication between the EV and EVSE and its use is not recommended. The portable cable used in Mode 2 has an inbuilt protection and control capability and is typically used for home charging. Modes 3 and 4, which provide a separate charger device to supply power to the EV, have improved control systems and are used for commercial or public charging Mode 2 Mode 1 Mode 3 Mode 4 Battery (2kW TO 22kW ) AC DC (2kW TO 200kW + ) DC 3 PIN Type 1 Type 2 CHAdeMo Combo 2 Type 2 On-board charger AC to DC Control pilot", "output": "..."}

Table 2 categorizes EV charging by power level, with normal power charging going up to 22kW and high- power charging going up to 200kW. While EVSEs with power ratings up to 500kW are globally available, they are largely applicable for heavy vehicles like buses and trucks. Normal power AC charging is adequate for e-2Ws, e-3Ws and e-cars. Normal power DC charging is unique to India, due to the prevalence of LEVs, and the use of low-voltage batteries in e-cars. Single-phase AC chargers, with a maximum power rating of 7kW, are adequate for LEVs and cars with single phase on-board chargers. Three-phase AC chargers, with a power rating up to 22kW, are required for e-cars with larger on- board chargers. Input power supply for normal power charging can be provided from the standard electricity distribution network. For high-voltage e-cars with battery capacities between 30-80kWh, high-power DC charging of 50kW is used. The power level of DC chargers in the market ranges between 25kW and 60kW. However higher- powered DC chargers will be available in the near future. While high-power DC charging takes less time for e-cars, it requires higher electricity supply with additional infrastructure. Normal power charging points are therefore adequate for most charging requirements, including slow or overnight charging of e-cars. --- Page 17 --- 17 1.1.3 BATTERY SWAPPING SWAPPABLE BATTERY CHARGING STATION TYPES OF BATTERY SWAPPING Manual: The battery swapping station is a standalone device, in which batteries are placed and removed manually from the individual slots, usually by hand. Manual swapping stations are modular and occupy a minimal amount of space. These are used for 2W and 3W battery applications, as the battery pack sizes are smaller and the weight can be handled by one or two persons. Autonomous: A robotic arm is used in these types of swapping stations with the battery swapping process being semi/fully automated. Robotic swapping is used for 4W and e-bus applications as battery packs are larger and heavier, and require mechanical assistance. These swapping stations are also more expensive and have a higher land requirement.

{"instruction": "...", "input": "--- Page 21 --- 21 FROM CHARGING STATIONS TO CHARGING POINTS 1.3 Charging stations refer to high-power EVSE, typically Mode 3 or Mode 4 charging, often with multiple charging guns. Charging points refer to normal power EVSE that can be accessed by a portable charging cable. While the initial deployment of public charging infrastructure in India focused on charging stations, it is increasingly evident that most public charging needs can be served by a densely distributed network of charging points (as seen in Box A). --- Page 22 --- 22 PUBLIC CHARGING POINTS BY POWER RATING 11/22kW 3.7/7.4kW 50kW 50-100kW Over 100kW BOX A: PUBLIC CHARGING POINTS IN THE EU Normal power charging points comprise the major share of all charging points among European countries. By end- 2019, public charging points in the EU numbered about 175,000. Of these, normal power charging points comprised 94%, while high power and ultra-high power charging points only comprised the remaining 6%. An EV charging network comprising many normal- powered charging points is preferable to one with limited high-power charging stations. For EVs, any parking location where the vehicle is stationary, and which has access to an EV charging point, can be an opportunity to recharge the vehicle battery. This is also known as destination charging, as opposed to “on- the-go charging” in which vehicles rapidly top up their battery charge to drive onwards to their destinations. Therefore, EV charging infrastructure should be provided in locations where vehicles are parked on a regular basis, rather than carving out new locations for EV charging hubs. This approach to charging infrastructure implementation promotes a distributed network of EV charging points for users to plug into at various locations - at residences, apartment buildings, office campuses, shopping malls, metro and railway stations, bus depots, etc. Such a distributed network approach has multiple advantages for users and operators, ranging from ease of access to financial viability. EASE OF ACCESS TO EV CHARGING By providing EV charging points at locations where vehicles tend to park, EV users can charge their vehicles while they are parked, thereby saving time, and eliminating the distance one must travel to access public charging.

Of these, normal power charging points comprised 94%, while high power and ultra-high power charging points only comprised the remaining 6%. An EV charging network comprising many normal- powered charging points is preferable to one with limited high-power charging stations. For EVs, any parking location where the vehicle is stationary, and which has access to an EV charging point, can be an opportunity to recharge the vehicle battery. This is also known as destination charging, as opposed to “on- the-go charging” in which vehicles rapidly top up their battery charge to drive onwards to their destinations. Therefore, EV charging infrastructure should be provided in locations where vehicles are parked on a regular basis, rather than carving out new locations for EV charging hubs. This approach to charging infrastructure implementation promotes a distributed network of EV charging points for users to plug into at various locations - at residences, apartment buildings, office campuses, shopping malls, metro and railway stations, bus depots, etc. Such a distributed network approach has multiple advantages for users and operators, ranging from ease of access to financial viability.

They will also vary over time as EV penetration increases. The MoP and MoHUA have set targets for public charging provision and for provision of EV charging in buildings, respectively (see Box C). State and local planning bodies may adopt these suggested targets or mandate more ambitious targets for their regions. 2 --- Page 36 --- 36 BOX C: GOVERNMENT OF INDIA TARGETS FOR EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE MOP TARGETS FOR PUBLIC CHARGING In its Charging Infrastructure Guidelines and Standards, the Ministry of Power (MoP) provides the following minimum requirements for the location of public charging stations: • At least one charging station should be available in a grid of 3km x 3km. • One charging station to be set up every 25km on both sides of highways/roads. As per MoP guidelines, public charging stations may contain one or more, or any combination, RI\u0003 FKDUJHUV\u0003 IURP\u0003 D\u0003 OLVW\u0003 RI\u0003 VSHFLͤHG\u0003 (96(\u0003 DQG\u0003 connector types. Charging stations for e-2Ws and e-3Ws can install any charger, provided they adhere to technical and safety standards laid down by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). MOHUA TARGETS FOR SEMI-PUBLIC CHARGING The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) amended its Model Building Byelaws (MBBL) 2016 to include the provision of EV charging in buildings. Amendments are made to Chapter 10 (Sustainability and Green Provisions) of the MBBL-2016, with Section 10.4 titled “Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure”. • Charging infrastructure shall be provided for EVs at 20% of all ‘vehicle holding capacity’/’parking capacity’ at the premises. • The building premises will have to have an additional power load, equivalent to the power required for all charging points to be operated simultaneously, with a safety factor of 1.25. The amendments are applicable to all buildings except independent residences. Further provision norms for slow chargers (SC) are provided based on the number of EVs to be serviced, by segment. Norms for fast chargers (FCs) are not compulsory. 4Ws 3Ws 2Ws PV (buses) PROVISION NORMS FOR CHARGING POINTS 1 SC per 3 EVs 1 FC per 10 EVs 1 SC per 2 EVs 1 SC per 2 EVs 1 FC per 10 EVs --- Page 37 --- 37 TARGET-SETTING FOR PUBLIC CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE Targets for public charging infrastructure are generally based on considerations of accessibility or of EV charging demand. ACCESS-BASED TARGETS aim to ensure minimal coverage across a city or region, and are typically measured in terms of “number of charging points/unit area.” They are more appropriate in the early stages of EV adoption, due to low EV charging demand. DEMAND-BASED TARGETS aim to provide sufficient public charging infrastructure for a growing number of EVs on the road. They are based on EV penetration rates and the number of electric kilometers driven. Demand-based targets are useful for a planned expansion of the public charging network, in line with projected EV growth. The next section covers the process of EV charging demand assessment for target- setting. Urban or regional targets for public EV charging should ideally be set by the working group for public charging infrastructure, in states where such a working group has been established. In its absence, targets may be set by the SNA, urban development authorities, municipal corporations or other local bodies involved in EV charging infrastructure planning. BUILDING BYELAWS FOR SEMI-PUBLIC CHARGING The MoHUA’s suggested amendments to the building byelaws ask for charging infrastructure to be provided at 20% of parking spaces for all new buildings.

For a given charging demand in an area, a distributed planning approach may be used to select multiple charging sites, with varying configurations of the number of chargers and power levels as required. This can reduce the space and electricity load requirements at each site, and enable more efficient network implementation. Sites for public charging may include on-street parking spots, off-street public parking, transit station parking areas, or any other location with adequate space and access for all EV owners.

For a given charging demand in an area, a distributed planning approach may be used to select multiple charging sites, with varying configurations of the number of chargers and power levels as required. This can reduce the space and electricity load requirements at each site, and enable more efficient network implementation. Sites for public charging may include on-street parking spots, off-street public parking, transit station parking areas, or any other location with adequate space and access for all EV owners. Ownership of sites may vary and may require multiple agreements for reserved charging use. --- Page 49 --- 49 SPACE REQUIREMENTS FOR CHARGING FACILITIES At any EV charging facility, adequate space must be allocated for vehicle parking and movement, installation of charge points, signage and barriers, and any upstream electrical infrastructure that may be required. The requisite space for a car parking bay is generally 5 x 2.5 meters. Including the vehicle circulation space, the Equivalent Car Space (ECS) for car parking is 23 to 32 square meters, depending on whether it is open parking or basement parking. This can be used as a thumb rule to determine the number of chargers to be provided. Depending on the parking location and the charger specifications, wall-mounted or pedestal-mounted chargers may be deployed, which will add to the required space in the parking area. Exclusive distribution transformers (DTs) are not a universal requirement, and are typically required only in case of high-tension (HT) electricity connections with multiple high-power charging points. Chapter 5 will cover electricity supply planning for EV charging and how to determine the need for upstream electrical infrastructure.

It depends on the type of parking area as well as the number and type of EV charge points that need to be accommodated at the site. For instance, normal power chargers can be wall- mounted, which is a less expensive and more space- efficient option. Charging installations in residential or commercial buildings may choose this option. For high-powered chargers in public off-street parking lots, pedestal-mounted charging equipment permits better maneuverability and can host multiple charging points in a single EVSE. When planning for EV charging integration at a given site, the following planning guidelines should be kept in mind: • Allocate space that is easily accessible and clearly visible from the site entrance. • Select the charging location to minimize civil work and wiring requirements, where possible. • Follow all safety provisions for EV charging planning as defined by the CEA (Measures relating to Safety and Electric Supply) (Amendment) Regulations, 2019. • Clearly demarcate the parking spaces reserved for EV charging with appropriate signage and markings. • Provide ample space for vehicle circulation i.e. to enter and exit the charging bays. • Ensure that the charging area is secured against theft and vandalism.

EV charging can be accommodated even at a single parking spot, or at many parking spots in a large parking lot. Therefore, the space required at each location may be small, but multiple locations are needed for an effective network. --- Page 53 --- 53 However, CPOs generally do not own the land for setting up charging infrastructure, and often there may be challenges in setting up public charging facilities in high-traffic, accessible locations for various reasons. • LACK OF CLARITY ON LAND OWNERSHIP: In many cases, the ownership of the land parcel on which EV charging is to be installed is not clear. For instance, while commercial shops and other establishments often govern the street parking outside their premises, this is often publicly owned land that can be reclaimed at any time for road widening or other such purposes. • POOR PLANNING AND REGULATION OF PARKING: Many established on-street or off-street parking spaces are illegal. While the parking activity is condoned, allied activities such as EV charging are not permitted. At the same time, there is paucity of planned public parking in several areas, which results in no space available to set up charging. • HIGH COST OF URBAN LAND: Where ownership is clear and legal parking is available, the cost of urban land can be prohibitive. Public parking is often operated by contractors that are unwilling to provide space for EV charging at sub-market rates. This poses a high entry barrier for CPOs due to the lack of assured demand for public charging during the early stages of EV adoption. This is also the case with government-owned land such as municipal parking, metro station parking, and other public parking areas. SNAs and urban planning authorities can alleviate these challenges, in turn supporting a more rapid scale-up of public charging infrastructure. Short-term measures allow immediate action to unlock land for EV charging, while more significant policy changes are needed to integrate EV charging in planning processes. MOUs BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES AND CPOs Land-owning authorities such as municipal corporations, urban development authorities and other local government bodies can provide access to desirable parking sites through Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with CPOs. The MoUs would be for a fixed period and would allocate the use of selected sites for EV charging. Revenue-sharing mechanisms with the CPO or an independent allocation of advertising rights at charging points could provide revenues to the government authority without burdening the financial viability of nascent EV charging services. This mechanism is most appropriate for empty plots and informal parking spaces outside shops and other buildings. Selected sites should be vetted by the traffic police to ensure that vehicular circulation is not disrupted. Site selection should ensure proximity to electricity supply points, to minimize civil work costs. SUPPORT LOW-COST CHARGING POINT IMPLEMENTATION AT PUBLIC PARKING LOCATIONS Innovations such as light EV charge points, streetlight chargers and other low-cost EVSE solutions are providing affordable solutions for charging infrastructure. ULBs can work with EVSE manufacturers and CPOs to integrate these low- cost charging points into existing parking areas, by permitting integration with street furniture such as streetlights and bollards, as seen in the example in Box F.

{"instruction": "...", "input": "--- Page 57 --- 57 CENTRAL TECHNICAL REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES The CEA has notified amendments to existing regulations to facilitate grid connectivity for charging infrastructure. Key regulatory provisions for EV charging are highlighted below. TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CONNECTIVITY OF THE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION RESOURCES (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 2019 • Defines “charging stations” and “charging points” • Recognizes EVs as an energy generation resource • Introduces standards for charging stations connected or seeking connectivity to the electricity supply system MEASURES RELATING TO SAFETY AND ELECTRIC SUPPLY (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 2019 • Specifies safety requirements for charging infrastructure including general safety for EV charging stations, earth protection system, fire safety, testing of charging stations, inspection and periodic assessment, maintenance of records, and safety provisions as per international standards that need to be followed. STATE REGULATIONS With electricity distribution and supply being a state subject as per the Indian Constitution, regulations at the state level determine the rules around connection and supply of electricity. The State Electricity Supply Code & Performance Standards Regulation, the purview of SERCs, is the key regulatory framework governing the provision of electricity connection and supply by DISCOMs. This regulatory framework differs from one state to another, and appropriate state regulations should be considered when planning or installing charging facilities. Among the provisions of the state supply code, the following issues especially impact electricity connections for EV charging. --- Page 58 --- 58 TYPE OF ELECTRICITY CONNECTION The type of connection – i.e., single-phase LT, three- phase LT, or high-tension (HT) – is decided based on the required sanctioned load, and directly impacts the cost and time for getting a connection, the tariffs, and the need for ancillary upstream infrastructure like Distribution Transformers (DTs). An HT connection attracts higher installation and monthly demand charges, involves more time for energization, and requires the set-up of ancillary electrical infrastructure by the applicant. The sanctioned load ceilings for LT and HT connections vary significantly between states. SUPPLY OF POWER FROM EXISTING NETWORK The rules governing supply of power from the existing network can have cost and time implications for commissioning an EV charging connection. Getting a connection from an existing network (without the need for expansion) is easier and more economical than a case which requires extension of the distribution system. Network extension is not only time-consuming but may also require the applicant to share the costs. NEED FOR SYSTEM AUGMENTATION FOR NEW CONNECTIONS A system upgrade is advised when the capacity utilization of the nearest feeder is expected to exceed the permitted threshold (commonly 70%) upon award of a new connection such as a charging infrastructure connection. Augmentation of the distribution network can be an expensive and time-consuming affair. A distributed public charging network can optimize the time and costs associated with getting power connections for EV charging, with lower sanctioned loads and fewer charging points at each site. In cases where a greater number of charging points is required or mandated through building byelaws and other government orders, these provisions can also lead to higher capital and operational costs, and can disincentivize EV charging installations. SERCs and DISCOMs need to recognize EV charging as a new type of consumer requirement, distinct from existing consumer categories, and adapt the supply code to enable affordable and reliable electricity supply for charging infrastructure. 5.1.1 TARIFF – AN IMPORTANT TOOL Electricity tariff is a critical fiscal and regulatory tool available to state governments, and tariffs and tariff designs vary from state to state. EV charging is a new addition to the consumer basket of a DISCOM, and recognizing it as a distinct consumer category in the tariff schedule can facilitate power connections for EV charging. Introducing an EV-specific electricity tariff has multiple benefits. Tariffs can be designed to send clear price signals to EV users, and can also be used to manage load profiles of EV charging. Electricity tariffs are also a major operating cost for CPOs providing charging services and can impact the business case for public EV charging. Further, a separate tariff category for EV charging will allow state governments to offer “EV- only” incentives in order to encourage adoption, with features such as: EXEMPTED DEMAND CHARGES: The fixed or demand charge for an electricity connection is levied on the sanctioned load for the connection or the maximum power demand registered during the billing period, which must be paid irrespective of the actual power usage. Considering the low demand for charging during the early phase of EV adoption, demand charge exemptions for EV charging connections can improve the business case for setting up charging points. REDUCED ENERGY CHARGES: Energy charges are the variable component of an electricity tariff, applied on the total volume of energy/electricity consumed during the billing period. Reduced energy charges for EV charging benefit CPOs, which can reduce their operational expenditure, and EV users benefit through lower charging costs.

Key regulatory provisions for EV charging are highlighted below. TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR CONNECTIVITY OF THE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION RESOURCES (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 2019 • Defines “charging stations” and “charging points” • Recognizes EVs as an energy generation resource • Introduces standards for charging stations connected or seeking connectivity to the electricity supply system MEASURES RELATING TO SAFETY AND ELECTRIC SUPPLY (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 2019 • Specifies safety requirements for charging infrastructure including general safety for EV charging stations, earth protection system, fire safety, testing of charging stations, inspection and periodic assessment, maintenance of records, and safety provisions as per international standards that need to be followed. STATE REGULATIONS With electricity distribution and supply being a state subject as per the Indian Constitution, regulations at the state level determine the rules around connection and supply of electricity. The State Electricity Supply Code & Performance Standards Regulation, the purview of SERCs, is the key regulatory framework governing the provision of electricity connection and supply by DISCOMs. This regulatory framework differs from one state to another, and appropriate state regulations should be considered when planning or installing charging facilities. Among the provisions of the state supply code, the following issues especially impact electricity connections for EV charging. --- Page 58 --- 58 TYPE OF ELECTRICITY CONNECTION The type of connection – i.e., single-phase LT, three- phase LT, or high-tension (HT) – is decided based on the required sanctioned load, and directly impacts the cost and time for getting a connection, the tariffs, and the need for ancillary upstream infrastructure like Distribution Transformers (DTs). An HT connection attracts higher installation and monthly demand charges, involves more time for energization, and requires the set-up of ancillary electrical infrastructure by the applicant. The sanctioned load ceilings for LT and HT connections vary significantly between states. SUPPLY OF POWER FROM EXISTING NETWORK The rules governing supply of power from the existing network can have cost and time implications for commissioning an EV charging connection. Getting a connection from an existing network (without the need for expansion) is easier and more economical than a case which requires extension of the distribution system. Network extension is not only time-consuming but may also require the applicant to share the costs. NEED FOR SYSTEM AUGMENTATION FOR NEW CONNECTIONS A system upgrade is advised when the capacity utilization of the nearest feeder is expected to exceed the permitted threshold (commonly 70%) upon award of a new connection such as a charging infrastructure connection. Augmentation of the distribution network can be an expensive and time-consuming affair. A distributed public charging network can optimize the time and costs associated with getting power connections for EV charging, with lower sanctioned loads and fewer charging points at each site. In cases where a greater number of charging points is required or mandated through building byelaws and other government orders, these provisions can also lead to higher capital and operational costs, and can disincentivize EV charging installations. SERCs and DISCOMs need to recognize EV charging as a new type of consumer requirement, distinct from existing consumer categories, and adapt the supply code to enable affordable and reliable electricity supply for charging infrastructure. 5.1.1 TARIFF – AN IMPORTANT TOOL Electricity tariff is a critical fiscal and regulatory tool available to state governments, and tariffs and tariff designs vary from state to state. EV charging is a new addition to the consumer basket of a DISCOM, and recognizing it as a distinct consumer category in the tariff schedule can facilitate power connections for EV charging. Introducing an EV-specific electricity tariff has multiple benefits. Tariffs can be designed to send clear price signals to EV users, and can also be used to manage load profiles of EV charging. Electricity tariffs are also a major operating cost for CPOs providing charging services and can impact the business case for public EV charging. Further, a separate tariff category for EV charging will allow state governments to offer “EV- only” incentives in order to encourage adoption, with features such as: EXEMPTED DEMAND CHARGES: The fixed or demand charge for an electricity connection is levied on the sanctioned load for the connection or the maximum power demand registered during the billing period, which must be paid irrespective of the actual power usage. Considering the low demand for charging during the early phase of EV adoption, demand charge exemptions for EV charging connections can improve the business case for setting up charging points. REDUCED ENERGY CHARGES: Energy charges are the variable component of an electricity tariff, applied on the total volume of energy/electricity consumed during the billing period. Reduced energy charges for EV charging benefit CPOs, which can reduce their operational expenditure, and EV users benefit through lower charging costs.

Generally, these establishments have their own HT connections with exclusive DTs and a high sanctioned load. In such circumstances, there is a convenient way to provide a separate LT metered connection, for EV charging, from the existing HT connection. DISCOMs can consider the provision of “minus metering” whereby an exclusive electricity connection for EV charging is drawn from the existing HT connection of the host establishment and the energy consumption for EV charging is measured using a submeter. The energy consumed for EV charging will then be billed based on the applicable EV tariff. Such an arrangement is easy to execute and is more cost- effective than drawing a new LT connection for the charging points. SEPARATE EV CONNECTION WITHOUT DEMAND CHARGES For a separate EV connection at a host establishment, the applicable demand/fixed charges must be paid separately for the EV connection. This is the case even if there is adequate sanctioned load on the existing electricity connection to support the power demand from EV charging. DISCOMs can consider waiving demand charges for separate EV connections in such cases, provided that the aggregate peak demand from both connections always remains lower than the sanctioned load of the original connection.

CPOs may find merit in setting up captive generation systems at locations where the quality of power supplied by the DISCOM is a major issue. NET METERING Net metering or net billing enables the deduction of electricity produced on-site using renewable energy from the total electricity consumed in a billing period. This helps lower a prosumer’s electricity bill (a “prosumer” is an agent that consumes electricity from the grid and can also inject electricity into the grid). The prosumer either pays for the difference in units or gets paid by the DISCOM for extra units at the end of the billing cycle. Many states have notified their Net Metering Regulations, which specify the parameters for consumers to participate by setting up renewable energy generation systems on their premises.

The total power demand for the desired configuration is 133 kW which exceeds the available hosting capacity of the nearest DT and the three-phase LT connection limits. The CPO has three main options to get the electricity supply: APPLY FOR AN HT CONNECTION AND SET UP OWN DT This option gives the CPO the liberty to accommodate the charging facility as planned. However, it must bear the cost of the DT along with the associated 33/11 kW cables, which can cost up to ` 2.5 lakhs. The CPO will also need additional space at the identified site for the ancillary electrical infrastructure (as seen in Chapter 4). Moreover, charges associated with the application for an HT connection, such as SLD charges, are higher, and the CPO may have to pay higher demand charges in its electricity bills. RECONFIGURE THE CHARGING PLAN SO THAT THE SANCTIONED LOAD FALLS WITHIN THREE-PHASE LT CATEGORY With a maximum sanctioned load of 65 kW, the CPO can either retain one 50-kW charger and the stack battery charging system or change the configuration to seven numbers of 7-kW chargers and the stack battery charging system, provided the necessary parking space is available at the site. The selected configuration depends on the charging requirements at the site location. However, this exceeds the available capacity at the nearby DT which therefore needs to be upgraded. The CPO can apply to the DISCOM for a new DT, which the DISCOM may take up as part of its standard grid upgrades. In this case, the CPO will not have to bear any additional cost for the DT. This is contingent on the DISCOM’s discretion and the applicable provisions of the state supply code regulations.

EVSE-CMS COMMUNICATION The Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) is an open-source, freely available standard that enables communication between an EVSE and a CMS, also known as a charging station network. It allows interoperability among different charging equipment, software systems, and charging networks, allowing users to switch between charging networks. It has features for device management, transaction handling, security, smart charging, etc. CPO-CPO COMMUNICATION The Open Charge Point Interface protocol (OCPI) supports information exchange between e-mobility service providers (e-MSPs) and charge point operators to enable automated roaming between charging networks for EV owners. Supported features include charge point information, charging session authorization, tariffs, reservation, roaming, and smart charging. CMS-DERMS (UTILITY CONNECTION) The Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR) protocol facilitates demand response signals between DISCOMs and EV users. The DERMS platform helps DISCOMs manage their distributed energy resource (DER) assets, which include electric vehicles. OpenADR enables energy demand management for EV charging through demand response signals, by throttling power drawn by EVSEs during periods of high demand. public and public charging. Private charging at home or for personal use is usually Mode 2 charging (Mode 1 is not recommended), and does not have smart charging capabilities. This makes home charging loads difficult to manage, as seen in the California example described earlier To partly address this issue, it is suggested that a market be created for low-cost chargers that can be programmed to synchronize with ToD tariffs. This will allow for passive management of private charging events, which can reduce excess demand on the grid during peak hours.

They include local authorities such as municipal corporations and urban development authorities, or state nodal agencies (SNAs) responsible for public charging infrastructure. Public land, aggregated from different government and public sector bodies, is provided for the installation of charging facilities. The charging equipment may be owned by government or by a CPO that is contracted to own and operate the charging services. BOX J: DELHI’S EV CHARGING AND BATTERY SWAPPING STATION TENDER Delhi Transco Ltd (DTL), as the State Nodal Agency (SNA) for charging infrastructure, has invited bids from private agencies to set up and operate public charging stations (PCS) across the city. The tender will be awarded to the companies charging the lowest service fees. The concessionaire is responsible for the supply, erection, testing, commissioning, maintaining and operations of the PCS at its own cost for the designated lease period. The concessionaire/ CPO will recover the cost via service fees. Land for setting up charging stations is provided by the government, with land parcels aggregated from various public agencies. Land is provided on a revenue-sharing basis, and the concessionaires will pay a fixed rate of INR 0.70/kWh of power sold to the site-owning agency, for the duration of the contract period (60 months). The DISCOMs are mandated to provide electricity connections up to 100kW sanctioned load for the public charging facilities. The concessionaires are responsible for obtaining EV metered connections, and for the energy charges for electricity used. Regulatory support for applications, permissions, quality checks, site feasibility, approvals, etc. is provided to the concessionaire by the SNA or any other body mandated in the contract. The SNA will also support the concessionaire in taking up early release of the electricity connection with the respective DISCOM. At the end of the lease period, the concessionaire may choose to take up ownership of the charging infrastructure assets after clearance by the land-owning agency and DISCOMs. This is a typical example of a public- private partnership (PPP) for EV charging implementation. SNAs in other states are considering similar models. For self-owned EV charging facilities, public sector agencies procure the EVSE equipment through an EPC contract with a partner. Charging services may be self-managed or outsourced to a CPO. Alternatively, government authorities may enter a PPP contract with a partner. Here, the relevant government agency invites CPOs to install and operate EV charging facilities for public use. In this model, governments offer financial subsidies, concessional land provision and/or energy supply to incentivize CPOs to reduce capital costs of implementation.

{"instruction": "...", "input": "85 7.2.3 SERVICE PROVIDER MODEL In the service provider model, it is the CPOs that drive EV charging provision for public and semi-public charging. The key distinguishing features of the service provider model are: • EVSE equipment is usually owned by the CPO • Land is sourced from a variety of owners, including public and private entities (this is especially true for private CPOs), and • Charging services are offered under the brand of the CPO. Private CPOs aim to establish a network of charging facilities in strategic locations with high potential charging demand. They source land parcels in selected locations from public or private entities, install EVSE equipment supplied by manufacturing partners, and operate paid EV charging services for public or semi-public use. CPOs may enter revenue-sharing arrangements with host establishments or other landowners for the use of land. DISCOMS (public and private) are also entering the charging infrastructure market as CPOs, as seen in Box L. These agencies typically use their own land to set up public EV charging facilities and operate them as paid services. DISCOMs may also provide bundled charging services for private EV owners, and recover the capital and operating costs through electricity tariffs. Other stakeholders driving the service provider model of EV charging implementation include industrial companies that are moving into charging infrastructure, and EV manufacturers that are setting up charging infrastructure networks as allied services. BOX L: GROWTH OF CPO-DRIVEN CHARGING NETWORKS A mix of public and private CPOs is currently leading the development of public charging infrastructure. EESL (Energy Efficiency Services Limited), a public-sector undertaking, had more than 200 charging stations operational by January 2021. Private-sector DISCOMs such as BSES Rajdhani and Tata Power have also been active in public charging infrastructure provision. Tata Power’s EV charging network comprises over 500 chargers in 100 cities. BSES Rajdhani, in July 2021, floated a tender to empanel charging infrastructure providers to deploy normal-power AC and DC chargers for semi-public and private use in Delhi.

Private CPOs with notable networks of public chargers include Fortum, Magenta, Charge+Zone, Volttic, Statiq, and Charzer, among others. Some CPOs specialize in different public charging use cases, ranging from 50-60kW DC fast charging stations to compact 3.3kW AC charge points and streetlight charging solutions. Battery charging and swapping providers include Sun Mobility and Lithion Power. Ather Energy, an EV manufacturer, has its own network of DC chargers for electric two-wheelers.

Direct current (DC) power: A form of electricity that is commonly available from batteries, solar cells, fuel cells, etc. Unlike AC power, it is characterized with one- directional flow of electric charge. Distributed energy resources (DER): An electricity- producing resource or a controllable electrical load that is connected to a local distribution system or connected to a host facility within the local distribution system. DERs can include solar panels, combined heat and power plants, electricity storage, electric vehicles, and electrical appliances such as air-conditioners and water heaters. Distributed energy resources management system (DERMS): A platform that helps a power disribution utility manage its Distributed Energy Resource assets including electric vehicles. Distribution transformer (DT):\u0003,W\u0003SURYLGHV\u0003WKH\u0003ͤQDO\u0003YROWDJH\u0003 transformation in the electric power distribution system, stepping down the voltage used in the distribution lines to the level used by the customer. e-Mobility service provider (e-MSP): An entity that offers charging services to EV drivers by providing access to charge points within its network or to other networks through e-roaming. Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE): An EVSE supplies electrical energy to charge EVs. The EVSE system includes electrical conductors, related equipment, software, and communications protocols WKDW\u0003GHOLYHU\u0003HQHUJ\\\u0003HIͤFLHQWO\\\u0003DQG\u0003VDIHO\\\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003YHKLFOH\u0011 EV-roaming (e-roaming): It allows EV users to charge their vehicles at at any charging station or charge point, regardless of which charging network it belongs to. E-roaming is enabled by open communication protocols or proprietary roaming networks, which bring different CPOs and e-MSPs on to a common platform. High tension (HT) connection: The electrical connection that is served by a supply line operating at a voltage between 11 kV and 33 kV. kilovolt (kV): A unit equal to 1,000 volts, used to express voltage of electricity transmission and distribution lines. kilowatt (kW): A unit equal to 1,000 watts, used to express the power of an electrical appliance or generator. kilowatt-hour (kWh): A unit equal to one kilowatt (kW) of power sustained for one hour, used to express the amount of electrical energy consumed by an electrical appliance or produced by an electrical generator. Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI): An open application protocol that supports connections between e-mobility service providers (eMSPs) and charge point operators (CPOs). Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP): An open-source, freely available standard that enables communication between an EVSE and a CMS, also known as a charging station network. Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR): A protocol designed to facilitate demand response signals between power distribution utilities and EV users. Public charging station (PCS): It is an EV charging facility that is typically accessed by all EV users for charging. Power Purchase Agreement (PPA): It is a contract between two parties, one which generates electricity (the seller) and one which is looking to purchase electricity (the buyer). Smart charging: Unidirectional active management of electric vehicle charging, including ramping charging levels up or down. Time of Day (ToD) tariffs: Different electricity rates at different times of the day, with higher prices in peak periods of high electricity consumption and lower prices in off-peak periods. GLOSSARY OF TERMS", "output": "A charge point operator (CPO) is an entity that installs and manages the operations of the charging infrastructure. They may own the charging infrastructure or provide services on behalf of the charge point owner."}
{"instruction": "...", "input": "--- Page 91 --- 91 CONCEPT AND BOOK DESIGN: The design of illustrations in the handbook is inspired by Madhubani and Gond Art, art forms that originate in the rich and varied heritage of regions across our country. Madhubani Art is a style of Indian painting that was traditionally created by the women of communities from a region in Bihar. Gond Art is a form of folk art practiced by one of the largest tribes in India- the Gonds- who are predominantly from Madhya Pradesh but also inhabit parts of adjoining states. The handbook aims to demystify electric vehicle charging, a highly technical topic and a critical component of electric mobility. In selecting the design style, the objective was to bring a story telling aspect to the content, in the form of illustrations like primitive art that could support the text and improve the reader’s understanding of the subject. A mix of Madhubani and Gond art, with the right amount of detailing and simplification of forms, was found to be the perfect style for rendering the illustrations. One will find the influences of Gond Art in the detailing of the masses in the vehicles and influences of Madhubani Art in the rendering of the eyes and the anatomy of human forms. This has resulted in a contemporary style of illustrations with the integration of the two art styles, representing a modern yet rooted India. The colour palette represents the cultural vibrancy of India, with the bright colours complemented by the contemporary typography to balance the design.
