Barriers
EV recharging

Lack of standardization among EV batteries
Batteries can be charged away from 
swapping point, allowing more freedom  
in setting up swap facilities
Unsuitable battery pack design to 
enable ease of swapping 
(weight, dimensions and ergonomics)
Reduction in upfront cost 
of EV, as battery ownership 
is replaced by battery leasing
Greater number of batteries needed 
to power same number of EVs
Increased predictability of battery life 
due to controlled charging conditions
Shorter commercial life of battery packs 
due to customer preference for 
new batteries with higher range

Slow adoption of charging method by OEMs

transformer (DT) level, which can be projected 
through impact assessments of localized 
charging loads on grid infrastructure at the

provider model are: 
• 
EVSE equipment is usually owned by the CPO
• 
Land is sourced from a variety of owners, including 
public and private entities (this is especially true 
for private CPOs), and
• 
Charging services are offered under the brand 
of the CPO
